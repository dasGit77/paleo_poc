Proof-of-concept work for PaleoSun.

In 1 day of setup and 4 days of work, I created a proof-of-concept website for PaleoSun. The website is built using ExpressionEngine for content management, PHP, and Javascript.

The tasks I completed were:
Code up the template using clean, semantic HTML and CSS. 
Build this in ExpressionEngine and make all of the text and image content editable. 
Make this design responsive (work on any screen size) and compatible with all modern browsers (IE9 and above) 
‘Recent Work’ section should also be a slider / paginated. 
Use responsive framework such as Bootstrap. 
Top area should be a content slider. Roll your own or use some fancy jQuery plugin 
Code your own [add-on / plugin / widget / module, etc] to pull the latest 4 blog posts from http://paleosun.com/blog/rss/ and output them in the Recent Posts section. 
Host this site on a server of your choice 


Bonus Points: 

Add any extra flare for extra points (fancy hover effects, transitions, etc) 
Make sure the final result gets a score of over 80% in both PageSpeed and YSlow when tested using https://gtmetrix.com/ 
Commit the project to Github or Bitbucket to track your progress
